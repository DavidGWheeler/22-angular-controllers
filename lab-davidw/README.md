# lab-22 Angular Controllers and scss

## A demo app illustrating the use of "Controller As" to control scope

### Setup:
Install the app:
`$ npm install`

Start the server:
`$ npm run build`

If you want to see debug output you can use this command to start the server:
`$ npm run watch`

You can also lint the files:
`$ npm run lint`

*Note:*
these files will be ignored:
`     **/node_modules/*
      **/vendor/*
      **/*.min.js
`
### Usage:

###### Simply enter some text and watch it change the default text of 'rawr' to your custom message.

###### If you click on the "Speak!" button, you see your customized character selection and text stored below, and a new button, "Undo!"  will appear in this section.  

###### Attributions:
Ben Ayzenberg helped me figure out the undo bug.
